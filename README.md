# KlockInAndOut
Suppose that you are building an application for a friend or for an employer. You are not a full time employee and they don't have a dedicated portal to log your hours. If this is the case, and you are expected to punch in and out (that is log your hours), this extension is the solution for you! Essentially, the extension produces an icon. If the user clicks on the icon, it tries to locate a `timesheet.xlsx` file. If it can not find one, it would create one with the first row in cells A1:D1 with the headers: `Date`, `Clocked-In`, `Clocked-Out`, and `Duration`. Then, it would find a new row and log in the first cell of that row the current date and the second cell the time. When you click the icon again, it would lg in the third cell the time "clocked-out" and compute the duration of time between `Clocked-In` and `Clocked-Out` in the same row and put the calculation in column D.
